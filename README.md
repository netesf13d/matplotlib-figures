Some matplotlib figures I made for my PhD. Feel free to use them as templates!

* An atom state manipulation scheme without plot. Illustrates the use of matplotlib.path.Path to make wavy lines.
* Cut views of the difference between two trapping potentials. Illustrates the use of colormaps and contours.
* Experimental data plot, with fit curve of a parameter from Monte-Carlo simulations. Illustrates the use of insets and color-mapping line plots.

Note that LaTeX is required in order to display the text correctly.
